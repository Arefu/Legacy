## Legacy - About

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/Arefu/Legacy/wiki) for more information.

The long and short of it is, when I first learnt about ROM hacking these games were some of the first I thought it would be cool to add different things to. I sadly worked out quickly that they compress the ever living hell out of basically everything in the game, and it seems no one has bothered to document how... Until now. No promises anything near the state of Pokemon modding will come of this, but this is my little area of the internet where I like to share what I find about various projects.
